# Terraform-GCP-Security

This repository uses Terraform to build out fundamental google cloud security services to comply with best practices. My goal is to cover the following security-related services:

1. Networks (VPCs, firewalls, subnets, routes, etc.)
2. Storage 
3. Key and Secrets Management
4. Data Protection
5. Logging

I leverage the existing Google Cloud and Haschicorp repo https://github.com/terraform-google-modules
