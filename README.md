# Terraform-GCP-Security-Network

This repository uses Terraform to build out fundamental google cloud network security services to comply with best practices. My goal is to cover the following security-related services:

1. VPCs
2. Firewalls
3. Subnets
4. Routes

with more to come over time...

I leverage the existing Google Cloud and Haschicorp repo https://github.com/terraform-google-modules
